 /**
 * FUNCTIONS:
 * 0. Functions are a block of code that performs a certain task. 
 * 1. The use of function is divided into two stages. We must first declare or define a function before we can build it. 
 * The keyword function is used to declare a function. Following that are parenthesis, which will hold a number of required inputs separated by commas.
 * These inputs are called parameters and they should be named accordingly so that it's clear what must be provided when the function is performed. 
 * 0. Parameters are rather declared variables specifically for that function, that is hoisted to the top on the function scope. 
 * 1. A single output is returned by the function and returns undefined by default. Otherwise, we may use the return keyword followed by a value. When the code block 
 * reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing. 
 * 2. Functions can be named, assigned to variables or constants, or be anonymous.  
 * 3. The second stage when using a function, is the invocation or function call. This will invoke the function to execute or run its code block. 
 * When we call a function we can pass in arguments to use within the function. The arguments give the parameters values to use. To call a function, we simply reference
 * the funcion name or variable name that it is assisgned to. We then pass any necessary arguments in paranthesis. 
 * 4. There are two types of scopes: global and local. Local scopes are local to a function body, whereas global scopes are everything outside of the function. 
 * Functions, in general, enclose a scope and protect its variables from parent scopes, such as the global scope. Variables in the parent scope can be accessed by 
 * functions. Parent scope, on the other hand, are unable to access variables in child scopes.
 * 5.
