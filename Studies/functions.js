/**
 * FUNCTIONS:
 * 0. Functions are a block of code that performs a certain task. 
 * 1. The use of function is divided into two stages. We must first declare or define a function before we can build it. 
 * The keyword function is used to declare a function. Following that are parenthesis, which will hold a number of required inputs separated by commas.
 * These inputs are called parameters and they should be named accordingly so that it's clear what must be provided when the function is performed. 
 * 0. Parameters are rather declared variables specifically for that function, that is hoisted to the top on the function scope. 
 * 1. A single output is returned by the function and returns undefined by default. Otherwise, we may use the return keyword followed by a value. When the code block 
 * reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing. 
 * 2. The second stage when using a function, is the invocation or function call.
